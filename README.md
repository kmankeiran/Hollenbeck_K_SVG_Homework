# The homework two file is the finished file that I am handing in. I have added a Navigation link that changes color when you hover over it. I added some hover effects with the SVG files and the buttons underneath them. When you hover the SVG it creates a shadow underneath it. When you hover over the click me button it will change color to red and when you click on it, it writes a message in the console sayin what Icon you have selected. I was not able to fix the colors in the JS with the "Selected", so I decided to do some CSS3 animations on the button instead.
